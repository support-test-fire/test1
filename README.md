 ### Links ###

            Markdown supports two styles for creating links: *inline* and
            *reference*. With both styles, you use square brackets to delimit the
            text you want to turn into a link.

            Inline-style links use parentheses immediately after the link text.
            For example:

            This is an [example link](http://example.com/).

            Optionally, you may include a title attribute in the parentheses:

            This is an [example link](http://example.com/ "With a Title").

            Reference-style links allow you to refer to your links by names, which
            you define elsewhere in your document:

            I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from
            [Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].

            [1]: http://google.com/        "Google"
            [2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"
            [3]: http://search.msn.com/    "MSN Search"
